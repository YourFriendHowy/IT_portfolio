### **1. Associate’s Degree (AA) – Computer Science**

- **Primary Goal**: Build a foundation in programming, data structures, and technology while gaining a qualification that provides good job prospects and flexible, potentially remote work.
- **Advantages**: Allows for a well-paying, flexible job that can support your studies and provide opportunities to gain field experience in conservation.
- **Potential Gap**: May require supplemental courses in biological sciences to meet prerequisites for a wildlife science-focused BA.

### **2. Bachelor’s Degree (BA) – Wildlife Science or Conservation Biology**

- **Primary Goal**: Focus on wildlife conservation, population dynamics, and habitat conservation, with an emphasis on fieldwork and ecological knowledge.
- **Potential Majors**:
    - **Wildlife Science**: Concentrates on the management and study of wildlife populations and their ecosystems.
    - **Conservation Biology**: Focuses more broadly on biodiversity conservation and ecological balance.
- **Recommendation**: Use your computer science background here to bring data-driven, technical skills into conservation projects, potentially by minoring in Environmental Informatics or taking courses in GIS or data analysis.

### **3. Master’s Degree (MA) – _Wildlife and Fisheries Science_ or Conservation Biology**

- **Primary Goal**: Specialize in data science applications for conservation, population modeling, and habitat management, combining computer science skills with in-depth conservation knowledge.
- **Recommended Programs**:
    - **Wildlife and Fisheries Science**: Focuses on managing wildlife populations, ecosystems, and aquatic habitats.
    - **Conservation Biology**: Offers a strong biological science foundation with potential applications in data and technology for species and habitat management.
