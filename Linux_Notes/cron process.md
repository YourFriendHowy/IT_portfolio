# crontabs
*Crontab is one of the processes that is started during boot, which is responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs.*

A crontab is simply a special file with formatting that is recognised by the `cron` process to execute each line step-by-step. Crontabs require 6 specific values:

| Value | Description                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| MIN   | What minute to execute at                 |
| HOUR  | What hour to execute at                   |
| DOM   | What day of the month to execute at       |
| MON   | What month of the year to execute at      |
| DOW   | What day of the week to execute at        |
| CMD   | The actual command that will be executed. |
Let's use the example of backing up files. You may wish to backup "cmnatic"'s  "Documents" every 12 hours. We would use the following formatting: 

`0 */12 * * * cp -R /home/cmnatic/Documents /var/backups/`
