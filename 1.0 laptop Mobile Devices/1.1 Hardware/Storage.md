# Storage([[Laptops]])
## Magnetic disk (HDD)
- Traditional spinning drive platters
- 2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops)

## Solid State Drive (SSD)
- All memory, no moving parts
- Silent, fast access time, less latency
- 2.5 inch form factors

## M.2
- Smaller form factor
- No SATA data or power cables
- Easy to install and replace
- Modular storage

## Replacing Laptop Storage
#### All internal
- Open a cover on the back
	or
- Open entire laptop
#### Can be very modular
- Two screws and the drive slides out

#### M.2 drives are easier
- 1 screw
- Similar to RAM installation

## Migrating from HDD to SSD
#### An impressive upgrade
- Move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state drive
- Its almost like getting a new laptop
#### Install an OS on the SSD
- Move user documents between drives
- Install any required applications
- Can be time consuming
#### Image/clone the HDD
- No OS installation required
- Move everything from one to the other
###### Imaging software needed
- Sometimes included with the SSD
- Many commercial and open sources

> [!NOTE] 
>Some companies create a single Image and use that to create multiple copies across multiple systems

###### Drive-to-drive image
- Image directly from one drive to another

## Additional Notes
SSD's are an upgrade to magnetic drives
