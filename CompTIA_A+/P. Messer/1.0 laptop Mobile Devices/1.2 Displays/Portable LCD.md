# LCD([[Laptops]])
## Liquid crystal display
- light shines through liquid crystals
### Advantages
- light weight
- relatively low power
- relatively inexpensive
### Disadvantages
- Black levels are a challenge
- Requires separate backlight
	- Florescent, LED, ETC.
	- Lights are difficult to replace
> [!multi-column] LCD Technologies
>> [!seealso] TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD
>> - The original LCD Technology
>> - Fast response times(Gaming!)
>> - Poor viewing angles - Color shifts
>
>> [!seealso] IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD
>> - Excellent  color representation
>> - More expensive to produce than TN
>
>> [!seealso]  VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD
>> - A good compromise between TN and IPS
>> - Good color representation
>> - Slower response times than TN
