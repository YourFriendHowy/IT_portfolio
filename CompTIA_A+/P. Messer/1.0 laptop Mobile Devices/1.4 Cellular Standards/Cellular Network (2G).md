## GSM

- Original GSM standard used multiplexing
	- Everyone gets a little slice of time
## CDMA
- Code Division Multiple Access
	- Everyone communicates at the same time
	- Each call uses a different code
	- the codes are used to filter each call on the receiving side
- Used by Verizon and Sprint
