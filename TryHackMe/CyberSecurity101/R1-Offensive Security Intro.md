# Task 1
- Introduced me to what offensive security is, the role of the "Hacker"
# Task 2
- A simple simulation of a bank hack and transfer of funds, didn't explain much, seems designed to show a beginner that hacking can be extremely simple and rewarding. It was a fun little exercise, but didn't explain details so felt like fluff to me.
# Task 3
- a quick summary of what jobs and branches are available in cyber security.

# Room complete!
