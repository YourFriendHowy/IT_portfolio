### Thoughts:  
Lets start today's entry with transparency, I skipped yesterday due to getting distracted with looking at servers on Facebook marketplace.
###### Touch Typing
Today went pretty well, i do notice that thew focus it takes begins to slow me down when i actually think about what I'm typing. I am beginning to use touch typing while typing other things besides practice. I am finding it to be difficult not to look at the keyboard while touch typing with the full keyboard and a fatigued mind from the practice sessions. I hope that I can build up a typing stamina quickly. This is 100% nicer then hunt and peck typing is.
