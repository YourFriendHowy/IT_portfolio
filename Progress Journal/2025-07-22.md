### What I did today:
- Studied JavaScript date syntax and usage (ref: [FreeCodeCamp-JS-date](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-get-current-date-todays-date-in-js/)).

### Vault Updates:
[[Changelog#2025-07-22|On This Day]]
- Created [[progress_template]]; added JS logic to auto-name new files with current date.
- Updated Obsidian vault organization structure

### Thoughts:  
Simple day today. I restructured the entire vault—added a properties panel to all files and reorganized folders for better clarity. Created new templates and studied JavaScript to automate file naming for Progress Journal entries using the current date. Initially struggled using MDN docs alone (ref: [MDN Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date)), but found a helpful tutorial on freeCodeCamp. Tried several approaches and ultimately chose **Moment.js** for its simplicity and clean syntax—it works great.

Achieved 15 minutes of practice on [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/). Currently at a challenging stage involving the mix of **S**, **T**, and **U**—fingers get twisted a lot. Accuracy is tough due to using a low-profile keyboard with Cherry MX Speed Silver switches. Progress is slow, but steady.
