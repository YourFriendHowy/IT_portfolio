### What I did today:
*Breakdown today's lessons, using commit styled bullets*
- Learned the difference between `apt` and `apt-get`
- Experimented with custom callouts in Obsidian
- Refined Linux vault structure by separating tools vs concepts

### Vault Updates:
*link changlog, touch on anything major*
- Created [[Linux/Apt Commands]]
- Updated [[Obsidian/Style Guide]] with color tweaks

### Thoughts:  
*Short passage on the days progress" IE:Starting to grasp package management more fluently. Found a good rhythm in taking notes while watching videos. Still need to research `snap` vs `flatpak`.*
