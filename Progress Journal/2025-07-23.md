### What I did today:
*Breakdown today's lessons, using commit styled bullets*
- Continued Professor Messer A+ course on YouTube, Finished  1.0 and moved into 2.0 networking.

### Vault Updates:
*link changlog, touch on anything major*
- Created Note Files for A+ Progression, [[A+_template]]

### Thoughts:  
*Short passage on the days progress" IE:Starting to grasp package management more fluently. Found a good rhythm in taking notes while watching videos. Still need to research `snap` vs `flatpak`.*
